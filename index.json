The occurrence of outliers will cause the optimal solution of the traditional phase retrieval objective function to deviate from the original signal, thereby reducing the reconstruction accuracy. This paper modifies the objective function by introducing a weight vector so that its optimal solution will still approximate the original signal when outliers appear, and proposes a specific implementation strategy for this idea under the background of Fourier phase retrieval. For the weight vector, we design a two-channel measurement structure, using discrete Fourier transform frequency domain cyclic shift theorem and mask technique to obtain a weight vector. For the improved objective function, we use the majorization-minimization framework to derive an iterative algorithm to get optimal solution. Extensive simulation and hardware experiments show that the proposed method can effectively suppress the adverse effects of outliers.","tags":[],"title":"Weighted Phase Retrieval of Fourier Measurement with Outliers Measurement Structure and Reconstruction Algorithm","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pinjun Zheng","Ning Fu","Liyan Qiao"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1603209600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603209600,"objectID":"159593fe58315b55a59a74ae871f2129","permalink":"https://zpinjun.github.io/publication/conference-papers/icassp2020.10.21_a-super-resolution-phase-retrieval-method-for-sparse-signals-with-arbitrary-scattering-function/","publishdate":"2020-10-21T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/conference-papers/icassp2020.10.21_a-super-resolution-phase-retrieval-method-for-sparse-signals-with-arbitrary-scattering-function/","section":"publication","summary":"The phase retrieval problem studies the recovery of the original signal from its phaseless Fourier intensity measurement. Unlike traditional phase retrieval algorithms that can only recover the discrete approximation of the original signal, the recently proposed super resolution phase retrieval theories can realize continuous-domain phase retrieval of sparse signals. However, these current methods maintain too strict restriction on the scattering function and there is unnecessary redundancy in the parameter estimation model. This paper proposes a novel super resolution sparse phase retrieval method suitable for arbitrary scattering function and can reduce nearly half of the redundant parameters. First, by iteratively processing the measurement results, we use Prony’s method to calculate the support intervals. Then, the support of the original signal can be restored through a reordering algorithm. Finally, under the premise of known support, recovering the amplitude is equivalent to solving a series of nonlinear equations, which can be solved by Chebyshev’s method. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.","tags":[],"title":"A Super Resolution Phase Retrieval Method for Sparse Signals with Arbitrary Scattering Function","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pinjun Zheng","Ying Liu","Ning Fu","Liyan Qiao"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1576857600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576857600,"objectID":"b894e5e32a70c194850c157d84859ffd","permalink":"https://zpinjun.github.io/publication/conference-papers/i2mtc2019.12.21_a-measurement-fault-elimination-method-in-one-dimensional-fourier-phase-retrieval-%E5%89%AF%E6%9C%AC/","publishdate":"2019-12-21T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/conference-papers/i2mtc2019.12.21_a-measurement-fault-elimination-method-in-one-dimensional-fourier-phase-retrieval-%E5%89%AF%E6%9C%AC/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper proposes a measurement fault elimination method applied to Fourier phase retrieval. In the phase retrieval problem, if the diffraction pattern is partially measured incorrectly, the accuracy of reconstruction results will be reduced. This paper considers one-dimensional Fourier phase retrieval and proposes a method that can search the faulty measurements out by comparing Fourier magnitude of different oversampling multiples, thus is possible to filter out pixels that are not working properly in the detector to improve the reconstruction algorithm. Numerical experiments show that the method proposed in this paper can effectively eliminate the influence of faulty measurement and obtain accurate reconstruction.","tags":[],"title":"A Measurement Fault Elimination Method in One-dimensional Fourier Phase Retrieval","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"  Designed and developed a small and easy to carry testing electronic system for electrical load of civil aviation aircraft.\n  Designed an embedded circuit board based on ZYNQ to collect and calculate the effective value of multi-channel AC, and to transmit the calculation results to the upper computer which could reduced the calculation load of the upper computer.\n  Achieved \u0026gt;100 ksps sampling rate of the single channel and the effective value acquisition error \u0026lt;0.5%, and could provide up to 64 AC parallel acquisition.\n  The following are some of the results (in Chinese): ","date":1550592000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1550592000,"objectID":"4c018fb559abff99e3535c1bf82cd473","permalink":"https://zpinjun.github.io/project/2019.04_ac-multi-channel-parallel-acquisition-and-processing-circuit-based-on-zynq/","publishdate":"2019-02-20T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/project/2019.04_ac-multi-channel-parallel-acquisition-and-processing-circuit-based-on-zynq/","section":"project","summary":"This is the graduation design of my Bachelor's degree.","tags":["ZYNQ","FPGA","Digital circuit design"],"title":"AC Multi-Channel Parallel Acquisition and Processing Circuit based on ZYNQ","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"  Designed and developed a small and easy to carry testing electronic system for electrical load of civil aviation aircraft.\n  Designed an embedded circuit board based on ZYNQ to collect and calculate the effective value of multi-channel AC, and to transmit the calculation results to the upper computer which could reduced the calculation load of the upper computer.\n  Achieved \u0026gt;100 ksps sampling rate of the single channel and the effective value acquisition error \u0026lt;0.5%, and could provide up to 64 AC parallel acquisition.\n  The following are some of the results (in Chinese): ","date":1550592000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1550592000,"objectID":"d22872f28c6b22932522e828d97b4156","permalink":"https://zpinjun.github.io/project/2019.07_tetris-game-based-on-fpga-and-vga-protocol/","publishdate":"2019-02-20T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/project/2019.07_tetris-game-based-on-fpga-and-vga-protocol/","section":"project","summary":"This is the graduation design of my Bachelor's degree.","tags":["ZYNQ","FPGA","Digital circuit design"],"title":"AC Multi-Channel Parallel Acquisition and Processing Circuit based on ZYNQ","type":"project"}]
