The occurrence of outliers will cause the optimal solution of the traditional phase retrieval objective function to deviate from the original signal, thereby reducing the reconstruction accuracy. This paper modifies the objective function by introducing a weight vector so that its optimal solution will still approximate the original signal when outliers appear, and proposes a specific implementation strategy for this idea under the background of Fourier phase retrieval. For the weight vector, we design a two-channel measurement structure, using discrete Fourier transform frequency domain cyclic shift theorem and mask technique to obtain a weight vector. For the improved objective function, we use the majorization-minimization framework to derive an iterative algorithm to get optimal solution. Extensive simulation and hardware experiments show that the proposed method can effectively suppress the adverse effects of outliers.","tags":[],"title":"Weighted Phase Retrieval of Fourier Measurement with Outliers Measurement Structure and Reconstruction Algorithm","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pinjun Zheng","Ning Fu","Liyan Qiao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1603209600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603209600,"objectID":"159593fe58315b55a59a74ae871f2129","permalink":"https://zpinjun.github.io/publication/conference-papers/icassp2020.10.21_a-super-resolution-phase-retrieval-method-for-sparse-signals-with-arbitrary-scattering-function/","publishdate":"2020-10-21T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/conference-papers/icassp2020.10.21_a-super-resolution-phase-retrieval-method-for-sparse-signals-with-arbitrary-scattering-function/","section":"publication","summary":"The phase retrieval problem studies the recovery of the original signal from its phaseless Fourier intensity measurement. Unlike traditional phase retrieval algorithms that can only recover the discrete approximation of the original signal, the recently proposed super resolution phase retrieval theories can realize continuous-domain phase retrieval of sparse signals. However, these current methods maintain too strict restriction on the scattering function and there is unnecessary redundancy in the parameter estimation model. This paper proposes a novel super resolution sparse phase retrieval method suitable for arbitrary scattering function and can reduce nearly half of the redundant parameters. First, by iteratively processing the measurement results, we use Prony’s method to calculate the support intervals. Then, the support of the original signal can be restored through a reordering algorithm. Finally, under the premise of known support, recovering the amplitude is equivalent to solving a series of nonlinear equations, which can be solved by Chebyshev’s method. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.","tags":[],"title":"A Super Resolution Phase Retrieval Method for Sparse Signals with Arbitrary Scattering Function","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pinjun Zheng","Ying Liu","Ning Fu","Liyan Qiao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1576857600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576857600,"objectID":"9527ac75195a757c7b64ceaf5d8e34eb","permalink":"https://zpinjun.github.io/publication/conference-papers/i2mtc2019.12.21_a-measurement-fault-elimination-method-in-one-dimensional-fourier-phase-retrieval/","publishdate":"2019-12-21T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/conference-papers/i2mtc2019.12.21_a-measurement-fault-elimination-method-in-one-dimensional-fourier-phase-retrieval/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper proposes a measurement fault elimination method applied to Fourier phase retrieval. In the phase retrieval problem, if the diffraction pattern is partially measured incorrectly, the accuracy of reconstruction results will be reduced.

See details about Admission Notice 、News and Brochure。\nThis year\u0026rsquo;s summer project is held in Weihai, from July 14th to July 26th. I submitted the registration form on June 25 and received the admission notice on July 4.\nProject We need to form a team of 3 to 4 people to develop a complete work in a week. Fortunately, my good friends H. Yan and Z. Piao were at the time, so we successfully formed an efficient team.\nThe title of the project we selected is \u0026ldquo;Embedded Tetris game based on FPGA and VGA protocol\u0026rdquo;. We use a Xilinx development board provided by the organizer, using VIVADO software and Verilog language for development. Unlike other software programming, we use FPGA to develop game logic, use five buttons on the development board as input to control the movement and rotation of Tetris, and the output is connected to the display using a VGA bus. We use the VGA protocol to control the output logic to make the display screen display what we want to display. Our project references this open source project. On the basis of the existing we have added several new functions:\n Display the next Tetris in the upper left corner of the interface. Display the current score in the upper right corner of the interface (the original project is to display the score on the development board with a digital tube). The opening image is displayed at the beginning of the game, and the ending image is displayed at the end of the game.  Our project can be found on my Github and CSDN.\nThe difficulty of the work we do is the display of images. Because VGA controls the three RGB color channels in the form of dot matrix scanning, it is relatively easy to implement regular geometric figures such as squares. To display the image in hardware language, we must first store the digital image information in RAM, and then send it to the VGA bus according to the mapping relationship during display. In order to achieve this, we first use the drawing tool to design the image we want to display, and then use Matlab to read the information of the digital image, convert the information of each pixel into a binary number, and then follow a certain order (three channels separate, The sequence is R\u0026gt;G\u0026gt;B. Each channel is scanned line by line, from top to bottom.). Write it to the .txt file according to the format of the .coe file, and finally change the suffix to .coe to obtain the storage information recognized by VIVADO. Then integrate the module into the project. Before the game starts, first output the image information in the .coe file to the VGA. Note that it must be output strictly in the order set before.\nFortunately, our work was finally rated as an excellent work.

There are strict international standards for measuring the effective value of airborne AC. Our project is carried out with reference to the ISO 12384 standard. The main features of airborne AC voltage acquisition task are:\n Multiple acquisition channels High sampling frequency requirements strict synchronization requirements Equipment miniaturization requirements  Considering that the complete test system also needs to measure other parameters, which will result in a large computing power load, we want to develop a lower computer circuit to undertake the multi-channel airborne AC rms measurement task to reduce the burden on the upper computer.\nTechnical Requirements  Equipment area is not less than 200 mm × 180 mm, height is not more than 100 mm. The sampling rate of the single voltage acquisition channel is not less than 100 ksps, and the sampling time is not more than 1s. The data bit width is not less than 14 bits. The voltage rms error does not exceed 0.5%. The number of acquisition channels is not less than 64, and the data of all the channels need to be acquired synchronously. The processed data is output using the standard RS 422 interface.  Overall Design Hardware Design The circuit hardware is mainly divided into the following four modules:\n Multi-channel data acquisition module ZYNQ core board main control module Data export module Power supply module  Software Design The ZYNQ chip used in this project is a all programmable SoC, which equipped with dual-core ARM Cortex-A9 processors (PS) and Kintex®-7 based programmable logic (PL). We use Verilog language to program PL part to control multiple AD chips to complete the parallel acquisition and data stream transmission task of instantaneous voltage. Use the C language to develop the PS part to complete the calculation of the effective value. The logic of the PL part is packaged into an IP core through the VIVADO software, and the ARM program controls the work of these IPs by reading and writing custom registers. The following figure shows the logical state machine of two IP cores:\nThe overall operation process of the software is shown in the following figure:  The ARM processor sends a PS_en rising edge trigger to the data master IP. The data master IP works, data is sampled and sent into the FIFO, which loop 1000 times. The data master IP sends PS_acquiDataOver to the ARM processor. The ARM processor starts the DMA transfer channel. The DMA controller transfers the data in the FIFO to the DDR memory. The DMA controller sends a signal to the ARM processor that the transfer is complete. The ARM processor reads data from the DDR memory. The ARM processor performs effective value calculation and exports the result to IP through RS422.  Product \u0026amp; Test  Single channel sampling rate is 167.79 ksps. The average time for any channel of the board to complete a data acquisition and calculation process is about 6.590 ms. The effective value acquisition error does not exceed 0.4%. The power consumption of the whole board is about 7.98 W.
